## 💪🏼 The Challenge

We'd like you to use this basic app scaffold to create a simple task app. The aim of this task is to give you an oppotunity to showcase your experience as a full stack developer. We've created a bare bones task app in the same stack we work in using the Laravel PHP framework, VueJs, InertiaJs and TailwindCSS.

[] Task 1
[] Task 2

Are you more of a frontend or backend dev? No worries. Do what you can to complete the task and we'll chat through your approach and anything you may have found challenging during your interview.

Good luck and happy coding! 🙌🏼

We and our franchises use our own bespoke web application to help run our business billing, messaging and contact management.
